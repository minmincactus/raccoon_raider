# 🦝 Raccoon Raider 🏴‍☠️  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
Ever wondered what life is like for a mischievous, treasure-hunting raccoon? We wanted to capture that chaotic, curious energy in an app that turns everyday objects into valuable loot. Inspired by raccoons' love for shiny things (and their talent for rummaging through trash), Raccoon Raider transforms the simple act of scanning objects into a playful pirate adventure.

But it’s not just about what you find—it’s about what everyone finds. We wanted to create a shared scavenger hunt, where players can see what others have discovered in their city, turning the app into a living, digital treasure map. Like raccoons leaving trails of their nightly escapades, users can log their finds and piece together a community-driven diary of urban exploration. Whether it’s a weird sticker on a street pole, a forgotten relic on the sidewalk, or an oddly shaped rock that just feels important, Raccoon Raider makes the small things feel exciting—and connects you to the people who notice them too.

## 🎮 Features  
- **Snap & Identify** – Take a picture of an object, and our AI will analyze it using Google Vision.
